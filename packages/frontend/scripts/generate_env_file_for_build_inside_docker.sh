# The wallet app's environment variables can only be configured at build time due to Parcel being used to build the wallet, which means that passing 
#  environment variables to a Docker container running a wallet wouldn't do anything.
# Parcel *does* store environment variables in a '.env' file in the root of the project though, so when we launch a Wallet Docker image we a) write a .env
#  file with the environment variables we want the wallet to have and b) rebuild the Wallet as part of the Docker container startup
# This script does the first part - taking environment variables set in the shell environment and writing them to a .env file for Parcel
